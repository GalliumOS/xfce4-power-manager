xfce4-power-manager (1.3.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Starting with 1.3, xfce4-power-manager no longer provides a tray icon, but
  relies only on the Xfce panel plugin in the xfce4-power-manager-plugins
  package, which is now recommended. The plugin (called Power Manager Plugin)
  can then be added to the Xfce panel.
